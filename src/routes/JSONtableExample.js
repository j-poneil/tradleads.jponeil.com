      "notes": "Excellent! Lead 2,3, and 5th pitches w/Maria. Did not bother with 6th pitch per friend's advice. Helped out a couple trying to bail off an 11R to the right while we were decending. Spectrum? Spectrum roof? Our rap station was higher than they were. I rapped down a bit so I was about level with them, they tossed me an end of their rope, then I ascended back up to our bolted anchor, passed it through and tossed it back to them so they would be set up for rappel off of it. Maria and I then rapped down. Guy and Girl chose to simulrappel AND traverse quite a bit while going down. Had warned them of the swing potential before we set this up but they said that they had done worse and I incorrectly trusted in their ablility. It was enough of a traverse that they couldn't stay completely weighted on the rope as you need to be for a simulrap, someone probably stood up or used a handhold for a second causing the other to suddenly drop a bit and lose their footing. Girl took a traversing against the wall swing/fall with barrel rolls, was shaken but \"OK\" . Did the rest of the raps to the bottom of the climb fine (also as simulraps), then she started freaking out a bit. Loopy. Had to leave our packs at the base, jog/walk/run to parking lot to get cell service, call in ambulence and helicopter, wait for police/ambulance to chat with them about the situation then hike back to get our packs. Girl and Guy walked out helicopter ground crew guys found them and chatted with them. Didn't stick around to find out if the girl decided to take the heli to the hospital or not. Apparently its a free service in Red Rock Canyon NCA? Ate jack in the box at like 1am for thanksgiving dinner... Lots of bad things happened. There were better ways we could have helped. We trusted in their ability and experience without knowing them personally and this was a bad idea. This was the reason I decided to take a WFR class... For one, if they had just built a gear anchor and bailed, that would have been fast and best for everyone, I should have encouraged this choice more. Else, to reduce the swing angle, I could have re-lead the pitch we had just rapped down from with one end of their rope, then set it up for rapp so their traverse would be a very mellow angle, though this would have taken longer and it was already very dark. Its also possible that the guy could have trad-lead traversed the face between us to get to our anchor, girl following/cleaning. It looked pretty do-able, but hard to know how good the face holds were. I'm thankful for \"light cannon\" headlamps that run off 18650 lithium ion batteries."

It's kinda a blur now. I led first pitch, it has a weird kinda bouldering start and traverse. I placed a cam, traversed, placed another and then traversed back to clean the first to reduce rope drag... ??? ... Maria led 2nd, it was a ton of kinda intimidating moves somewhat chimney but using face moves, back stepping, etc. Proud of her. She was done after her pitch. I lead the rest of the pitches, but had her lead accross the horizontal traverse at the end since I already had her on belay. Accidently left a pink tricam and sling in the dark, another group w/Du climbed the route the next day and returned it at the rental house. The squeeze chimney parts on this were cool but freaky. I was only expecting the tunnel pitch to be the chimney part, instead this route was chimneys everywhere. As well did the tunnel on far left as a squeeze to feet/back stem chimney instead of whatever is normal. Route was a pain with my homemade white D40 alpine-style bag in tow, though I guess it gave it a good thrashing/durability test. If I ever do this route again, must make sure to only have a simple water bladder and the follower carries it or otherwise go fast and light."

      "notes": "Mellow. Mostly face climbing on great crimps and jugs. Maria led 1st pitch to wrong anchor, then dropped a cam (#3). So she lowered me on a munter, I retrieved it, climbed back up, got the rack down-lead-climbed to the proper belay spot placing ~3 pieces so she would have a safer traverse follow. Cluster then started with multiple groups coming up and getting to the proper belay just as we were getting there. I led next linking the 2nd and 3rd pitches with a 70m. Was a really damn cool pitch. Chill easy climbing with a great crack for protection. I would like to try it another time jamming the crack more than using the face, but I felt rushed from the multiple groups. Made the belay to the right of the normal belay spot as otherwise it would become very crowded. Then maria led the next pitch and traversed to the top of the column thing. Was hard for her to build an anchor there, not the best options. Then I lead the 5th pitch up the corner to the top. Parts of the corner were a little interesting, some slight intimidation with run outs, but everything was there. Protection opportunities were not the best in some places. Additionally there was some chimney, like full on knees on one side feet on the other chimney. Maybe 8-12' hard to remember exactly. Little intimidating with not amazing placements below, but short and felt fairly secure. Used 3 aliens for the last belay then went over easy stuff to the right and followed cairns for descent. Nitecore headlamp batt was dead, like no voltage dead so had to share Maria's. Will keep a small backup headlamp or spare batt in my chalkbag for future MP. "

I have been spending too much time at Austin Bouldering Project, a lot of my endurance is gone, I pumped out and had to rest multiple times, but didn't hang. The first ~2 protection placements on this thing are very easy to accidently knock around and hard to avoid doing so. High up I followed the main flake and went a little too high, had to down climb/clean about 15ft then traverse over to the anchor, which is quite far to the left and shared with all 4 of the main routes at the triple cracks sanctuary. (Owl, middle, beckys, grass). Some other routes are pretty close to here too, but I don't know that much about them. Paul followed and cleaned, then I lowered him on a munter just to get him down fast and declutter. Then I set up for rappelling, over-under coiled my rope starting with both ends so that when tossing it would be much less likely to get caught on any flakes or make knots. Tossed, rapped, and pulled without issues. Maybe next time I'm in the area I'll do it again... and MAYBE do middle crack too. Beckys is intimidating to try to protect and climb if you do it in the pure offwidth start style."

The way the layback flake angles to the right makes it a good idea to extend pieces, else they will want to rotate as you climb above them, had this happen to both of us... thus the moving down a few moves, re-adjusting the cam in question and hanging on it.
